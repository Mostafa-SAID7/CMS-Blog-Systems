      "content": "# TypeScript Best Practices for Large-Scale Applications\n\nTypeScript has become the go-to choice for building large-scale JavaScript applications. Its static typing system helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability. Here are the best practices every TypeScript developer should know.\n\n## Type Safety First\n\nAlways prioritize type safety over convenience. Use strict TypeScript configuration and avoid `any` types whenever possible.\n\n```typescript\n// Good\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\n// Avoid\nconst user: any = getUserData();\n```\n\n## Utility Types\n\nLeverage TypeScript's built-in utility types to create more flexible and reusable code:\n\n- `Partial<T>` - Makes all properties optional\n- `Required<T>` - Makes all properties required\n- `Pick<T, K>` - Creates a type with selected properties\n- `Omit<T, K>` - Creates a type without specified properties\n\n## Generic Constraints\n\nUse generic constraints to create more specific and useful generic types:\n\n```typescript\ninterface Identifiable {\n  id: string;\n}\n\nfunction updateEntity<T extends Identifiable>(entity: T): T {\n  // Implementation\n  return entity;\n}\n```\n\n## Discriminated Unions\n\nUse discriminated unions for type-safe state management:\n\n```typescript\ntype LoadingState = \n  | { status: 'loading' }\n  | { status: 'success'; data: any }\n  | { status: 'error'; error: string };\n```\n\n## Module Organization\n\nOrganize your types and interfaces in dedicated modules:\n\n- Create `types/` directory for shared types\n- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports\n- Keep domain-specific types close to their usage\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFollowing these TypeScript best practices will help you build more robust, maintainable applications. Remember that TypeScript is a tool to help you write better JavaScript, so embrace its features and let it guide you toward better code architecture.",

      "content": "# React Performance Optimization: Advanced Techniques\n\nBuilding performant React applications is crucial for providing excellent user experiences. This guide covers advanced techniques to optimize your React applications for maximum performance.\n\n## Understanding React Performance\n\nReact performance issues typically stem from:\n- Unnecessary re-renders\n- Large bundle sizes\n- Inefficient state management\n- Poor component architecture\n\n## Optimization Techniques\n\n### 1. Memoization\n\n**React.memo**\nPrevents unnecessary re-renders of functional components:\n\n```jsx\nconst ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {\n  return <div>{/* Complex rendering logic */}</div>;\n});\n```\n\n**useMemo Hook**\nMemoizes expensive calculations:\n\n```jsx\nconst expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {\n  return computeExpensiveValue(data);\n}, [data]);\n```\n\n**useCallback Hook**\nMemoizes function references:\n\n```jsx\nconst handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n  // Handle click logic\n}, [dependency]);\n```\n\n### 2. Code Splitting\n\nSplit your code into smaller chunks that load on demand:\n\n```jsx\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Virtual Scrolling\n\nFor large lists, implement virtual scrolling to render only visible items:\n\n```jsx\nimport { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';\n\nconst VirtualizedList = ({ items }) => (\n  <List\n    height={600}\n    itemCount={items.length}\n    itemSize={50}\n  >\n    {({ index, style }) => (\n      <div style={style}>\n        {items[index]}\n      </div>\n    )}\n  </List>\n);\n```\n\n### 4. State Management Optimization\n\n**State Colocation**\nKeep state as close to where it's used as possible:\n\n```jsx\n// Good: State is colocated\nfunction UserProfile() {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  // Component logic\n}\n\n// Avoid: Lifting state unnecessarily high\n```\n\n**State Normalization**\nNormalize complex state structures:\n\n```jsx\n// Normalized state structure\nconst initialState = {\n  users: {\n    byId: {},\n    allIds: []\n  },\n  posts: {\n    byId: {},\n    allIds: []\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Bundle Optimization\n\n**Tree Shaking**\nEnsure your bundler can eliminate dead code:\n\n```jsx\n// Good: Named imports enable tree shaking\nimport { debounce } from 'lodash';\n\n// Avoid: Default imports include entire library\nimport _ from 'lodash';\n```\n\n**Dynamic Imports**\nLoad modules conditionally:\n\n```jsx\nconst loadChart = async () => {\n  const { Chart } = await import('./Chart');\n  return Chart;\n};\n```\n\n## Performance Monitoring\n\n### React DevTools Profiler\nUse the Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks:\n\n1. Install React DevTools\n2. Open Profiler tab\n3. Record interactions\n4. Analyze render times\n\n### Web Vitals\nMonitor Core Web Vitals:\n- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n- First Input Delay (FID)\n- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\n### Custom Performance Metrics\n\n```jsx\nconst usePerformanceMetrics = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {\n      list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {\n        console.log(entry.name, entry.duration);\n      });\n    });\n    \n    observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'] });\n    \n    return () => observer.disconnect();\n  }, []);\n};\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Profile Before Optimizing**: Use tools to identify actual bottlenecks\n2. **Optimize Gradually**: Make incremental improvements\n3. **Measure Impact**: Verify that optimizations actually improve performance\n4. **Consider User Experience**: Balance performance with functionality\n5. **Stay Updated**: Keep up with React updates and new optimization techniques\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n- Over-memoization can hurt performance\n- Premature optimization without profiling\n- Ignoring bundle size impact\n- Not considering mobile performance\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReact performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires careful analysis, strategic implementation, and continuous monitoring. By applying these advanced techniques thoughtfully, you can build React applications that provide exceptional user experiences across all devices and network conditions.\n\nRemember: measure first, optimize second, and always validate your improvements with real-world testing.",
